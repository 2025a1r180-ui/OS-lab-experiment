## 📖 THEORY

Linux provides several commands to obtain user information and process text files. These commands are useful for system administration, file management, and shell scripting.

### 1. User Information Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `whoami` | Displays the current username. |
| `id` | Displays user ID (UID) and group ID (GID). |
| `who` | Displays currently logged-in users. |
| `date` | Displays the current date and time. |
| `last` | Displays previous login records. |

### 2. Text Processing Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `cat` | Displays file contents. |
| `wc -l` | Counts the number of lines. |
| `wc -w` | Counts the number of words. |
| `wc -m` | Counts the number of characters. |
| `sed` | Extracts or modifies text in a file. |
| `grep` | Searches for a specified word or pattern. |
| `sort` | Sorts lines alphabetically. |
| `sort -u` | Sorts lines and removes duplicates. |

### 3. Important Command Syntax

**Counting lines, words, and characters:**

```bash
wc -l filename
wc -w filename
wc -m filename
```

**Extracting a specific line:**

```bash
sed -n '1p' filename
```
