## 📚 04. THEORY

### 1. What is a Shell?

A shell is a command-line interpreter that allows users to interact with the operating system.

It accepts commands from the user, interprets them and executes the requested operations.

### 2. What is Bash?

Bash stands for **Bourne Again Shell**.

It is a widely used command-line shell in Linux systems that allows users to execute commands, manage files, navigate directories and automate tasks through shell scripts.

### 3. What is a Terminal?

A terminal is an interface through which users interact with the shell by entering commands and viewing their output.

In Ubuntu, the terminal provides access to Linux commands and system utilities.

### 4. What is a File System?

A file system is a method used by an operating system to organize and store files and directories.

Linux uses a hierarchical file-system structure that starts from the root directory `/`.

### 5. What is a Directory?

A directory is a location used to store and organize files and other directories.

For example:

```text
/home/user/Documents
```

### 6. What is a File?

A file is a collection of data stored in the computer system.

Examples include:

- `notes.txt`
- `program.c`
- `readme.md`
- `data.csv`

### 7. What are File Permissions?

File permissions determine which users can read, write or execute a file or directory.

Linux provides three basic permission types:

| Permission | Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Read | `r` | Allows reading file contents. |
| Write | `w` | Allows modifying file contents. |
| Execute | `x` | Allows executing a file or accessing a directory. |

| 02 | `ls` | Lists files and directories. |
| 03 | `ls -l` | Displays detailed file information. |
| 04 | `cd Documents` | Changes the current directory. |
| 05 | `mkdir OS_Practical` | Creates a new directory. |
| 06 | `touch notes.txt` | Creates an empty file. |
| 07 | `cat notes.txt` | Displays file contents. |
| 08 | `cp notes.txt backup.txt` | Copies a file. |
| 09 | `mv notes.txt new_notes.txt` | Renames or moves a file. |
| 10 | `rm backup.txt` | Deletes a file. |

## 🔍 06. DETAILED COMMAND EXPLANATION

### 1. Print Working Directory — `pwd`

**Command:**

```bash
pwd
```

**Purpose:** Displays the absolute path of the current working directory.

**Example Output:**

```text
/home/user
```

**Explanation:** This command helps users identify their current location in the Linux file system.

### 2. List Files and Directories — `ls`

**Command:**

```bash
ls
```

**Purpose:** Lists files and directories available in the current directory.

**Example Output:**

```text
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures
```

**Explanation:** Displays the names of files and directories without detailed information.

### 3. List Files with Details — `ls -l`

**Command:**

```bash
ls -l
```

**Purpose:** Displays detailed information about files and directories.

**Example Output:**

```text
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 120 Oct 30 10:00 notes.txt
drwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Oct 30 10:00 Documents
```

**Explanation:** Displays file permissions, number of links, owner, group, size, modification date and filename.

### 4. Change Directory — `cd`

**Command:**

```bash
cd Documents
```

**Purpose:** Changes the current working directory to Documents.

**Explanation:** After executing this command, the terminal moves into the Documents directory if it exists in the current location.

### 5. Create a Directory — `mkdir`

**Command:**

```bash
mkdir OS_Practical
```

**Purpose:** Creates a new directory named `OS_Practical`.

**Explanation:** This command creates a directory in the current working location.

### 6. Create an Empty File — `touch`

**Command:**

```bash
touch notes.txt
```

**Purpose:** Creates an empty file named `notes.txt` if it does not exist.

**Explanation:** If the file already exists, `touch` updates its modification timestamp.

### 7. Display File Contents — `cat`

**Command:**

```bash
cat notes.txt
```

**Purpose:** Displays the contents of the file `notes.txt`.

**Explanation:** It reads the contents of a file and displays them in the terminal.

**Note:** If the file is empty, no content will be displayed.

### 8. Copy a File — `cp`

**Command:**

```bash
cp notes.txt backup.txt
```

**Purpose:** Creates a copy of `notes.txt` named `backup.txt`.

**Explanation:** The original file remains unchanged while a duplicate file is created.

### 9. Rename a File — `mv`

**Command:**

```bash
mv notes.txt new_notes.txt
```

**Purpose:** Renames `notes.txt` to `new_notes.txt`.

**Explanation:** The `mv` command can also be used to move files and directories from one location to another.

### 10. Remove a File — `rm`

**Command:**

```bash
rm backup.txt
```

**Purpose:** Deletes the file named `backup.txt`.

**Explanation:** This command removes the specified file from the file system.

**Precaution:** Use this command carefully because deletion through `rm` normally does not move the file to the graphical trash.

### 11. Display Current Date and Time — `date`

**Command:**

```bash
date
```

**Purpose:** Displays the current system date and time.

**Explanation:** Shows the date, time and timezone information configured in Ubuntu.

**Command:**

```bash
whoami
```

**Purpose:** Displays the username of the currently logged-in user.

**Example Output:**

```text
user
```

### 13. Display File Permissions — `ls -l`

**Command:**

```bash
ls -l
```

**Purpose:** Displays file permissions, ownership, file size and modification time.

**Example:**

```text
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 120 Oct 30 10:00 notes.txt
```

**Permission Explanation:**

```text
-rw-r--r--
```

| Part | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-` | Regular file |
| `rw-` | Owner permissions |
| `r--` | Group permissions |
| `r--` | Other users' permissions |

### 14. Display Help for a Command — `man`

**Command:**

```bash

- Linux commands are case-sensitive.
- Check the current directory using `pwd` before performing file operations.
- Ensure that the specified directory exists before using `cd`.
- Use unique filenames to avoid accidentally overwriting existing files.
- Use `rm` carefully because deleted files may not be recoverable.
- Check file contents before copying or deleting files.
- Press `q` to exit the manual page.
- Capture screenshots showing actual command execution and output.
- Avoid executing unfamiliar commands without understanding their purpose.

---

## 🏆 14. RESULT

The basic Bash/Shell commands for file-system navigation, file and directory management, text manipulation and system operations were successfully studied and executed in Ubuntu Linux.

The commands `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `cat`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `date`, `whoami` and `man` were used to understand the basic working of the Linux command-line interface.

File permissions, ownership and directory information were also examined using the `ls -l` command.

**Hence, the experiment was successfully completed.**
