A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software-based computer that operates like a physical computer.

It has virtual hardware components such as:

- Virtual CPU
- Virtual RAM
- Virtual Hard Disk
- Virtual Network Adapter
- Virtual Display

### 4. What is Ubuntu Linux?

Ubuntu is a free and open-source Linux-based operating system.

It provides a user-friendly desktop environment, command-line interface and various tools for programming, system administration and software development.

### 5. What is an ISO Image?

An ISO image is a file that contains the complete installation data of an operating system.

In this experiment, the Ubuntu ISO image is attached to the virtual machine and used to install Ubuntu Linux.
